# Sobelow

This project is in development, and not ready for use. Currently `sobelow` can flag
reflected XSS, and hardcoded secrets in configuration.

In the future, it will be able to highlight additional XSS vectors, stored XSS,
additional configuration suggestions, SQL injection, potential directory traversal,
and more.
